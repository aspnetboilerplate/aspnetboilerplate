What is ABP?
------------

ASP.NET Boilerplate is a starting point for new modern web applications using best practices and popular tools. It's aimed to be a __SOLID__ model, a general-purpose __application framework__ and a project __template__.

### Framework

ASP.NET Boilerplate is an application framework built on latest __ASP.NET Core__, __ASP.NET MVC__ & __Web API__ technologies. It makes easy to use dependency injection, logging, validation, exception handling, localization and so on. It makes these not only itself but also using popular framework and libraries.

### Architecture

ASP.NET Boilerplate implements __NLayer architecture__ (Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation Layers) and __Domain Driven Design__ (Entities, Repositories, Domain/Application Services, DTO's...). Also implements and provides a good infrastructure to implement __best practices__ such as __Dependency Injection__.

### Template

ASP.NET Boilerplate easily creates startup template for your project. It includes most used framework and libraries by default. Also allows you to choice __Single-Page__ (Angularjs) or __Multi-Page__ (MVC) architecture, EntityFramework or NHibernate as ORM.
