			<h3 id="DocIntro">Introduction</h3>
			<p>Domain Services (or just Service, in DDD) is used to perform domain 
operations and business rules. Eric Evans describes a good Service in three 
characteristics (in his DDD book):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <strong>operation</strong> relates to a <strong>domain concept</strong> 
	that is not a natural part of an Entity or Value Object.</li>
				<li>The <strong>interface</strong> is defined in terms of other elements of
					<strong>domain model</strong>.</li>
				<li>The operation is <strong>stateless</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unlike <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">Application Services</a> 
which gets/returns <a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">Data 
Transfer Objects</a>, a Domain Service gets/returns <strong>domain objects</strong> 
(like <a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">entities</a> or value types). </p>
			<p>A Domain Service can be used by Application Services and other Domain 
Services, but not directly used by presentation layer (application service is 
for that).</p>

			<h3 id="DocBases">IDomainService Interface and DomainService Class</h3>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate defines <strong>IDomainService interface</strong> that is 
implemented by all domain services conventionally. When it's implemented, the 
domain service is <strong>automatically registered</strong> to
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency Injection</a> system 
as <strong>transient</strong>.</p>

			<p>Also, a domain service (optionally) can inherit from <strong>DomainService 
class</strong>. Thus, it can use power of some inherited properties for logging, 
localization and so on... Surely, even if it does not inherit, it can inject 
they if needs.</p>

			<h3 id="DocExample">Example</h3>
			<p>Assume that we have a task management system and we have business rules while 
assigning a task to a person.</p>

			<h4 id="DocInterface">Creating an Interface</h4>
			<p>First, we define an interface for the service (not required, but as a good 
practice):</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public interface ITaskManager : <strong>IDomainService</strong>
{
    void AssignTaskToPerson(Task task, Person person);
}</pre>
			<p>As you can see, <strong>TaskManager</strong> service works with domain objects: a
				<strong>Task</strong> and a <strong>Person</strong>. There are some conventions 
of naming domain services. It can be TaskManager, TaskService or 
TaskDomainService...</p>

			<h4 id="DocImpl">Service Implementation</h4>
			<p>Let's see the implementation:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskManager : <strong>DomainService</strong>, <strong>ITaskManager</strong>
{
    public const int MaxActiveTaskCountForAPerson = 3;

    private readonly ITaskRepository _taskRepository;

    public TaskManager(ITaskRepository taskRepository)
    {
        _taskRepository = taskRepository;
    }

    public void AssignTaskToPerson(Task task, Person person)
    {
        if (task.AssignedPersonId == person.Id)
        {
            return;
        }

        if (task.State != TaskState.Active)
        {
            throw new ApplicationException(&quot;Can not assign a task to a person when task is not active!&quot;);
        }

        if (HasPersonMaximumAssignedTask(person))
        {
            throw new UserFriendlyException(L(&quot;MaxPersonTaskLimitMessage&quot;, person.Name));
        }

        task.AssignedPersonId = person.Id;
    }

    private bool HasPersonMaximumAssignedTask(Person person)
    {
        var assignedTaskCount = _taskRepository.Count(t =&gt; t.State == TaskState.Active &amp;&amp; t.AssignedPersonId == person.Id);
        return assignedTaskCount &gt;= MaxActiveTaskCountForAPerson;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>We have two business rules here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A task should be in <strong>Active state</strong> in order to assign it to a new Person.</li>
				<li>A person can have a <strong>maximum of 3</strong> active tasks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You can wonder why I throwed an <strong>ApplicationException</strong> for 
first check and <strong>UserFriendlyException</strong> for second check (see
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Handling-Exceptions">exception handling</a>). This is 
not related to domain services at all. I did this for just an example, it 
completely up to you. I thought that user interface must check a task's state 
and should not allow us to assign it to a person. I think this is an application 
error and we may hide it from user. Second one is harder to check by UI and we 
can show a readable error message to the user. Just for an example.</p>

			<h4 id="DocUsingFromAppService">Using from Application Service</h4>
			<p>Now, let's see how to use TaskManager from an application service:</p>

			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskAppService : ApplicationService, ITaskAppService
{
    private readonly IRepository&lt;Task, long&gt; _taskRepository;
    private readonly IRepository&lt;Person&gt; _personRepository;
    <strong>private readonly ITaskManager _taskManager;
</strong>
    public TaskAppService(IRepository&lt;Task, long&gt; taskRepository, IRepository&lt;Person&gt; personRepository, <strong>ITaskManager taskManager</strong>)
    {
        _taskRepository = taskRepository;
        _personRepository = personRepository;
        _taskManager = taskManager;
    }

    public void AssignTaskToPerson(AssignTaskToPersonInput input)
    {
        var task = _taskRepository.Get(input.TaskId);
        var person = _personRepository.Get(input.PersonId);

        <strong>_taskManager.AssignTaskToPerson(task, person);</strong>
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Task <strong>Application Service</strong> uses given <strong>DTO</strong> (input) and 
				<strong>repositories</strong> to retrieve 
related <strong>task</strong> and <strong>person</strong> and passes them to the 
				<strong>Task Manager</strong> (the domain 
service).</p>

			<h3 id="DocDiscussions">Some Discussions</h3>
			<p>Based on the example above, you may have some questions.</p>

			<h4 id="DocWhyNotOnlyAppServices">Why Not Only Application Services?</h4>
			<p>You can say that why application service does not implement the logic in the 
domain service?</p>
			<p>We can simply say that it's not application service task. Because it's not a
				<strong>use-case</strong>, instead, it's a <strong>business operation</strong>. 
We may use same 'assign a task to a user' domain logic in a different use-case. Say 
that we may have <strong>another screen</strong> to somehow update the task and 
this updating can include assigning the task to another person. So, we can use 
same domain logic there. Also, we may have<strong> 2 different UI</strong> (one 
mobile application and one web application) that shares same domain or we may 
			have a web API for remote clients that includes a task assign 
			operation.</p>
			<p>If your domain is simple, will have only one UI and assigning a task to a 
person will be done in just a single point, then you may consider to skip domain 
services and implement the logic in your application service. This will not be a 
best practice for DDD, but ASP.NET 
Boilerplate does not force you for such a design.</p>

			<h4 id="DocHowToForceDomainService">How to Force to Use the Domain Service?</h4>
			<p>You can see that, application service simply could do that:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public void AssignTaskToPerson(AssignTaskToPersonInput input)
{
    var task = _taskRepository.Get(input.TaskId);
    <strong>task.AssignedPersonId = input.PersonId;</strong>
}</pre>
			<p>The developer write the application service may not know there is a 
				<strong>TaskManager</strong> and can directly set given <strong>PersonId</strong> to task's 
				<strong>AssignedPersonId</strong>. So, 
how to <strong>prevent</strong> it? There are many discussions in DDD area based on these and there are some used 
patterns. We will not go very deep. But, we 
will provide a simple way of doing it.</p>
			<p>We can change <strong>Task</strong> entity as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class Task : Entity&lt;long&gt;
{
    public virtual int? AssignedPersonId { get; <strong>protected set;</strong> }

    //...other members and codes of Task entity

<strong>    public void AssignToPerson(Person person, ITaskPolicy taskPolicy)
    {
        taskPolicy.CheckIfCanAssignTaskToPerson(this, person);
        AssignedPersonId = person.Id;
    }</strong>
}</pre>
			<p>We changed setter of <strong>AssignedPersonId</strong> as <strong>protected</strong>. 
So, it can not be changed out of this Task entity class. Added an <strong>
AssignToPerson</strong> method that takes a person and a task policy. <strong>
CheckIfCanAssignTaskToPerson</strong> method checks if it's a valid assignment 
and throws a proper exception if not (it's implementation is not important here). Then application service method will be like that:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public void AssignTaskToPerson(AssignTaskToPersonInput input)
{
    var task = _taskRepository.Get(input.TaskId);
    var person = _personRepository.Get(input.PersonId);

    <strong>task.AssignToPerson(person, _taskPolicy);</strong>
}</pre>
			<p>We injected ITaskPolicy as _taskPolicy and passed to 
			AssignToPerson method. Now, there is no second way of assigning a task to a person. We should always 
use AssignToPerson and can not skip business rules.</p>
