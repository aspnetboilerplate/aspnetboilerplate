			<h3 id="DocIntroLayers">Introduction</h3>
			<p>Layering of an application's codebase is a widely accepted technique to help
reduce complexity and improve code reusability. To achieve layered
architecture, ASP.NET Boilerplate follows the principles of <strong>Domain Driven
Design</strong>. In Domain Driven Design there are four fundamental layers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: Provides an interface to the user.
	Uses the Application Layer to achieve user interactions.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Application Layer</strong>: Mediates between the Presentation
	and Domain Layers. Orchestrates business objects to perform specific
	application tasks.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Domain Layer</strong>: Includes business objects and their rules.
	This is heart of the application.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong>: Provides generic technical
	capabilities that support higher layers. An example of the Infrastructure
	Layer can be a Repository implementation used to interact with a database through an
	ORM framework, or an implementation for an email provider to send emails.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There may be additional layers added as necessary. An example being:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Distributed Services Layer</strong>: Used to expose application
	features to remote clients. There are tools like ASP.NET Web API and WCF that
	can provide this layer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are all common layers of a domain-centric architecture. There may be minor
differences based on implementation.</p>

			<p>Here is a solution with five projects for a simple layered application:</p>
			<p>
				<img alt="A solution structure" height="114" src="images/StsSolutionStructure2.png" width="248" />
			</p>
			<p>A layer can be implemented as one or more assemblies. It may be good to create more than one assembly for third-party dependencies (like 
			EntityFramework here) for larger projects. Also, there may be 
			bounded contextes where every context has it's own layers.</p>

			<h4 id="DocDomainLayer">Domain (Core) Layer</h4>
			<p>Domain Layer is where all business rules should be implemented.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">Entities</a> represent data and operations
of the business domain. Generally they are mapped to database tables in practice.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repositories</a> are collection-like
objects and are used to retrieve and persist entities on a data source (database).
Domain Layer defines repositories, but does not implement them. They are
implemented in the Infrastructure Layer.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/EventBus-Domain-Events">Domain Events</a> are used
to define domain-specific events as well as to trigger and handle them. 
				<a href="Domain-Services.html">Domain
services</a> work with entities (and other domain objects) and implement business rules which do not belong
within a single entity.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">Unit of Work</a> is a 
				design pattern used to manage database connection and 
				transaction, track entity changes and save changes to a data store. 
				It's defined in domain layer, but implemented in infrastructure 
				layer.</p>
			<p>This layer should be independent of third-party libraries as much as possible.</p>

			<h4 id="DocAppLayer">Application Layer</h4>
			<p>Application Layer contains <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">
application services</a> those are used by the Presentation Layer. An application
service method can receive a <a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">DTO</a>
			(Data Transfer Object) as input, uses this input to perform some 
			specific domain layer operation, and may return another DTO, if 
			needed. It should not
receive or return entities. An application service method is generally considered a
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work#DocAppServices">Unit of Work</a>.
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">User input validation</a>
is also implemented in this layer. It's suggested to use a tool for mapping entities to
DTOs such as the <a href="http://automapper.org" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>
library. We have also <a href="Abp-Session.html">session</a> here to obtain 
			information on current user.</p>

			<h4 id="DocInfraLayer">Infrastructure Layer</h4>
			<p>While Domain Layer defines interfaces for <a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">repositories</a>,
			<a href="Unit-Of-Work.html">unit of work</a> and other services, Infrastructure Layer implements those interfaces. 
			It implements repositories using ORM tools like
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/NHibernate-Integration" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> or
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/EntityFramework-Integration" target="_blank">EntityFramework</a>.
ASP.NET Boilerplate provides base classes to work with these two ORM frameworks.
Infrastructure Layer is used to abstract away dependencies on third-party
libraries from the other layers.
				<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768664/Introduction-to-ASP-NET-Boilerplate#InfraMigrations" target="_blank">
Database Migrations</a> can be used here as well.</p>
			<p>Beside database access, we may have abstractions for service 
			providers. For example, we may use a vendor to send SMS messages. We 
			can define an interface in domain or application layer to abstract it from our 
			code. Then we can implement that interface in the infrastructure 
			layer.</p>

			<h4 id="DocPresentationLayer">Web &amp; Presentation Layers</h4>
			<p>Web Layer is implemented using <a href="MVC-Controllers.html">ASP.NET MVC</a>,
			<a href="Web-API-Controllers.html">Web API</a> and
			<a href="AspNet-Core.html">ASP.NET Core</a>. Two different
approaches can be implemented here: Single-Page Applications or Multi-Page
Applications. <a href="/Templates">Startup templates</a> support both of them.</p>
			<p>In a <strong>Single-Page Application (SPA)</strong> all resources are loaded once
(or a core resource is loaded and others are lazy loaded when needed) to the
client (browser) and then all subsequent interaction with the server is made
using AJAX calls. HTML code is generated on the client-side with data received
from server. The entire page is never refreshed; views are just swapped in and
out as necessary. There are many Javascript SPA frameworks, such as
				<a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a>,
				<a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">BackboneJs</a>, and
				<a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">EmberJs</a>. 
			ASP.NET Boilerplate can work with any of them, but provides samples 
			and some helper mechanisms to easily work with Angular.</p>
			<p>In a <strong>Multi-Page (Classic) Application (MPA)</strong>, client makes
a request to the server, the server side code (ASP.NET MVC Controllers in 
			general) gets data
from the database, and Razor views generate HTML. These generated pages are sent
back to the client to display it. Each new page results in a full page refresh. 
			Client then can make additional AJAX requests for better user 
			experience.</p>
			<p>SPA and MPA involve completely different architectures. An admin panel is a
perfect candidate for a SPA. On the other hand, a blog better fits to the MPA
model since it is desirable to have it crawled by search engines. Even though
there are tools to help make SPAs visible to search engines, the general approach
is as such for the time being.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> is a perfect
tool to send push-<a href="Notification-System.html">notifications</a> from the server to the client. It can be used to
provide a rich, real-time experience to the user.</p>
			<p>There are many Javascript libraries &amp; frameworks on the client side.
				<a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is the most popular in
this area with thousands of free plug-ins. There are also tools/frameworks
that make it easy to work with HTML &amp; CSS. For example, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is a very popular HTML/CSS framework option.</p>
			<p>ABP provides infrastructure to automatically create a Web
API Layer from your application services and easily use it with Javascript (see
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">documentation</a>). Additionally, it
provides infrastructure to manage application <a href="Navigation.html">menus</a>, <a href="/Pages/Documents/Localization">localization</a>,
and language switching. Also included is a simple and unified <a href="/Pages/Documents/Javascript-API">Javascript API</a>
to simplify showing system messages and notifications.</p>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically <a href="/Pages/Documents/Handling-Exceptions">handles exceptions</a> 
			in server-side
and returns an appropriate response to the client.</p>

			<h3 id="DocOthers">Others</h3>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate uses and supports <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency Injection</a> through
the <a href="https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/blob/master/docs/README.md" target="_blank">Castle Windsor</a> framework.
It also uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" target="_blank">Log4Net</a> for <a href="/Pages/Documents/Logging">logging</a>
server-side, however, easily supports swapping in other logging libraries
without code change by the help of Castle's abstract logging facility.</p>

			<h3 id="DocLayeringSummary">Summary</h3>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate leverages some of the best frameworks/libraries in addition
to its own classes and systems to provide a great infrastructure to
build web applications with an NLayer architecture. It also has <a href="/Templates">templates</a>
that can be used to easily create a layered solution as a starting point for
your application.</p>
