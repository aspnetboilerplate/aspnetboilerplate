<h3 id="DocIntroLayers">Introduction</h3>
<p>Layering of an application's codebase is a widely accepted technique to help
reduce complexity and improve code reusability. To achieve this layered
architecture, ASP.NET Boilerplate follows the principles of <strong>Domain Driven
Design</strong>. In Domain Driven Design there are four fundamental layers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: Provides an interface to the user.
	Uses the Application Layer to achieve user interactions.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: Mediates between the Presentation
	and Domain Layers. Orchestrates business objects to perform specific
	application tasks.</li>
	<li><strong>Domain Layer</strong>: Includes business objects and their rules.
	This is the heart of the application.</li>
	<li><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong>: Provides generic technical
	capabilities that support higher layers. An example of the Infrastructure
	Layer is a Repository being used to interact with a database through an
	ORM framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be additional layers added as necessary. An example being:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Distributed Service Layer</strong>: Used to expose application
	features to remote clients. There are tools like ASP.NET Web API and WCF that
	can provide this layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all common layers of a domain-centric architecture. There may be minor
differences based on implementation.</p>

<p>Here is a solution with five projects for a simple layered application:</p>
<p>
<img alt="A solution structure" height="114" src="/SiteFiles/Content/Documents/Resources/StsSolutionStructure2.png" width="248" /></p>
<p>A layer can be implemented as one or more assemblies. It may be especially
good to create more than one assembly for third-party dependencies (like
NHibernate).</p>

<h4 id="DocDomainLayer">Domain (Core) Layer</h4>
<p>The Domain Layer is where all business rules should be implemented.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">Entities</a> represent data and operations
of the business domain. Generally they are mapped to database tables in practice.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repositories</a> are collection-like
objects and are used to retrieve and persist entities on a data source (database).
The Domain Layer defines repositories, but does not implement them. They are
implemented in the Infrastructure Layer.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/EventBus-Domain-Events">Domain Events</a> are used
to define domain-specific events as well as to trigger and handle them. Domain
services work with entities and implement business rules which do not belong
within a single entity.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">Unit of Work</a> is a design pattern
used to manage entities who have been affected by business logic and persist
their state to a data store.</p>
<p>This layer should be independent of third-party libraries as much as possible.</p>

<h4 id="DocAppLayer">Application Layer</h4>
<p>The Application Layer contains <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">
application services</a> that are used by the Presentation Layer. An application
service method receives a <a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">DTO</a>
(Data Transfer Object) as input, uses this input to perform some specific domain
layer operation, and may return another DTO, if needed. Generally, it does not
receive or return entities which allows the Presentation Layer to be abstracted
from the Domain Layer. An application service method is generally considered a
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work#DocAppServices">Unit of Work</a>.
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">User input validation</a>
is also implemented in this layer. ASP.NET Boilerplate provides infrastructure to
implement validation easily. It's suggested to use a tool for mapping entities to
DTOs such as the <a href="http://automapper.org" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>
library.</p>

<h4 id="DocInfraLayer">Infrastructure Layer</h4>
<p>While the Domain Layer defines interfaces for <a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">repositories</a>,
the Infrastructure Layer implements those interfaces using ORM tools like
<a href="/Pages/Documents/NHibernate-Integration" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> or
<a href="/Pages/Documents/EntityFramework-Integration" target="_blank">EntityFramework</a>.
ASP.NET Boilerplate provides base classes to work with these two ORM frameworks.
The Infrastructure Layer is used to abstract away dependencies on third-party
libraries from the other layers.
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768664/Introduction-to-ASP-NET-Boilerplate#InfraMigrations" target="_blank">
Database Migrations</a> can be used here as well.</p>

<h4 id="DocPresentationLayer">Web &amp; Presentation Layers</h4>
<p>The Web Layer is implemented using ASP.NET MVC and Web API. Two different
approaches can be implemented here: Single-Page Applications or Multi-Page
Applications.</p>
<p>In a <strong>Single-Page Application (SPA)</strong> all resources are loaded once
(or a core resource is loaded and others are lazy loaded when needed) to the
client (browser) and then all subsequent interaction with the server is made
using AJAX calls. HTML code is generated on the client-side with data received
from server. The entire page is never refreshed; views are just swapped in and
out as necessary. There are many Javascript SPA frameworks, such as
<a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a>,
<a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">DurandalJs</a>,
<a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">BackboneJs</a>, and
<a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">EmberJs</a>. ASP.NET Boilerplate
can work with any of them, but provides samples and some helper mechanisms to
easily work with AngularJs and DurandalJs.</p>
<p>In a <strong>Multi-Page (Classic) Application (MPA)</strong>, the client makes
a request to the server, the server side code (ASP.NET MVC Controllers) gets data
from the database, and Razor views generate HTML. These compiled pages are sent
back to the client for display. Each new page results in a full page refresh.</p>
<p>SPA and MPA involve completely different architectures. An admin panel is a
perfect candidate for a SPA. On the other hand, a blog better fits to the MPA
model since it is desirable to have it crawled by search engines. Even though
there are tools to help make SPAs visible to search engines, the general approach
is as such for the time being.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> is a perfect
tool to send push-notifications from the server to the client. It can be used to
provide a rich, real-time experience to the user.</p>
<p>There are many Javascript libraries &amp; frameworks on the client side.
<a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is the most popular in
this area with thousands of free plug-ins. There are also tools/frameworks
that make it easy to work with HTML &amp; CSS. For example, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is a very popular HTML/CSS framework option.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides the infrastructure to automatically create a Web
API Layer from your application services and easily use it with Javascript (see
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">documentation</a>). Additionally, it
provides the infrastructure to manage application menus, <a href="/Pages/Documents/Localization">localization</a>,
and language switching. Also included is a unified <a href="/Pages/Documents/Javascript-API">Javascript API</a>
to simplify showing system messages and notifications.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically <a href="/Pages/Documents/Handling-Exceptions">handles exceptions</a> server-side
and returns an appropriate response to the client.</p>

<h3 id="DocOthers">Others</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate uses and supports <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency Injection</a> through
the <a href="http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx" target="_blank">Castle Windsor</a> framework.
It also uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" target="_blank">Log4Net</a> for <a href="/Pages/Documents/Logging">logging</a>
server-side, however, easily supports swapping in other logging libraries
without code change using Castle's logging facility.</p>

<h3 id="DocLayeringSummary">Summary</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate leverages some of the best frameworks/libraries in addition
to its own classes and systems to provide a great infrastructure on which to
build web applications with an NLayer architecture. It also has <a href="/Templates">templates</a>
that can be used to easily create a layered solution as a starting point for
your application.</p>
