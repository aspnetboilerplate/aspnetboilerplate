			<p>In C#, a class can define own events and other classes can register it to be 
notified when something happen. This is useful for a desktop application or 
standalone windows service. But, for a web application it's a bit problematic 
since objects are created in a web request and they are short-lived. It's hard 
to register some class's events. Also, directly registering to another class's 
event makes classes tightly coupled.</p>
			<p>Domain events can be used to decouple business logic and react to 
			important domain changes in an 
application.</p>
			<h3 id="DocEventBus">EventBus</h3>
			<p>EventBus is a <strong>singleton</strong> object that is shared by all other classes to trigger and 
handle events. To use the event bus, you should get a reference to it. You can 
do it in two way.</p>
			<h4 id="DocInjectEventBus">Injecting IEventBus</h4>
			<p>You can use 
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">dependency injection</a> to get 
a reference to <strong>IEventBus</strong>. Here, we used property injection pattern:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskAppService : ApplicationService
{
    <strong>public IEventBus EventBus { get; set; }</strong>

    public TaskAppService()
    {
        <strong>EventBus = NullEventBus.Instance;</strong>
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Property injection is more proper than constructor injection to inject the 
event bus. Thus, your class can work without event bus. NullEventBus implements 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern" target="_blank">null object pattern</a>. When you call it's methods, it does nothing at all.</p>
			<h4 id="DocGetDefaultEventBus">Getting The Default Instance</h4>
			<p>If you can not inject it, you can directly use <strong>EventBus.Default</strong>. It's the global event 
bus and can be used as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs"><strong>EventBus.Default</strong>.Trigger(...); //trigger an event</pre>
			<p>It's <strong>not suggested</strong> to directly use 
			EventBus.Default wherever possible since it makes unit testing 
			harder.</p>
			<h3 id="DocDefineEvents">Defining Events</h3>
			<p>Before trigger an event, you should define the event first. An event is 
represented by a class that is derived from <strong>EventData</strong>. Assume 
that we want to trigger an event when a task is completed:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskCompletedEventData : <strong>EventData</strong>
{
    public int TaskId { get; set; }
}</pre>
			<p>This class contains properties those are needed by class that handles 
the event. <strong>EventData</strong> class defines <strong>EventSource</strong> 
(which object triggered the event) and <strong>EventTime</strong> (when it's triggered) 
properties.</p>
			<h4 id="DocPredefinedEvents">Predefined Events</h4>
			<h5>Handled Exceptions</h5>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate defines <strong>AbpHandledExceptionData</strong> and 
triggers this event when it automatically handles any exception. This is 
especially useful if you want to get more information about exceptions (even 
ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically logs all exceptions). You can register to this 
event to be informed when an exception occurs.</p>
			<h5>Entity Changes</h5>
			<p>There are also generic event data classes for entity changes: <strong>
EntityCreatingEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;, 
EntityCreatedEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;</strong>, <strong>
EntityUpdatingEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;,
EntityUpdatedEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;,
EntityDeletingEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;</strong> and <strong>
EntityDeletedEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;</strong>. Also, there are <strong>
EntityChangingEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;</strong> and <strong>
EntityChangedEventData&lt;TEntity&gt;</strong>. A change can be insert, update 
or delete.</p>
			<p>'ing' events (ex: EntityUpdating) are triggered before saving changes. So, 
	you can rollback the <a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">unit of work</a> 
	to prevent the operation by throwing exceptions in these events. 'ed' events 
	(ex: EntityUpdated) are triggered after saving changes and no chance to 
	rollback the unit of work.</p>
			<p>Entity change events are defined in <strong>
Abp.Events.Bus.Entities</strong> namespace and are <strong>automatically 
triggered</strong> by ASP.NET Boilerplate when an entity is inserted, updated or deleted. 
If you have a Person entity, can register to EntityCreatedEventData&lt;Person&gt; to 
be informed when a new Person created and inserted to database. These events 
also supports inheritance. If Student class derived from Person class and you 
registered to EntityCreatedEventData&lt;Person&gt;, you will be informed when a Person 
or Student is inserted.</p>
			<h3 id="DocTriggerEvents">Triggering Events</h3>
			<p>Triggering an event is simple:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskAppService : ApplicationService
{
    <strong>public IEventBus EventBus { get; set; }</strong>

    public TaskAppService()
    {
        EventBus = NullEventBus.Instance;
    }

    public void CompleteTask(CompleteTaskInput input)
    {
        //TODO: complete the task on database...
        <strong>EventBus.Trigger(new TaskCompletedEventData {TaskId = 42});</strong>
    }
}</pre>
			<p>There are some overloads of the trigger method:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">EventBus.Trigger&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(new TaskCompletedEventData { TaskId = 42 }); //Explicitly declare generic argument
EventBus.Trigger(this, new TaskCompletedEventData { TaskId = 42 }); //Set 'event source' as 'this'
EventBus.Trigger(typeof(TaskCompletedEventData), this, new TaskCompletedEventData { TaskId = 42 }); //Call non-generic version (first argument is the type of the event class)</pre>

<p>Another way of triggering events can be using DomainEvents collection of 
AggregateRoot class (see related section in the <a href="Entities.html">Entity 
documentation</a>).</p>

			<h3 id="DocHandleEvents">Handling Events</h3>

			<p>To handle an event, you should implement <strong>IEventHandler&lt;T&gt;</strong> 
interface as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class ActivityWriter : <strong>IEventHandler&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;</strong>, ITransientDependency
{
    <strong>public void HandleEvent(TaskCompletedEventData eventData)</strong>
    {
        WriteActivity(&quot;A task is completed by id = &quot; + eventData.TaskId);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>IEventHandler defines HandleEvent method and we implemented it as 
			shown above.</p>
			<p>EventBus is integrated to dependency injection system. As we implemented 
ITransientDependency above, when a TaskCompleted event occured, it creates a new 
instance of ActivityWriter class and calls it's HandleEvent method, then 
disposes it. See
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">dependency injection</a> for 
more.</p>
			<h4 id="DocHandleBaseEvent">Handling Base Events</h4>
			<p>Eventbus supports <strong>inheritance</strong> of events. For example, you can create a 
				<strong>TaskEventData</strong> and two derived classes: <strong>TaskCompletedEventData</strong> and
				<strong>TaskCreatedEventData</strong>:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskEventData : <strong>EventData</strong>
{
    public Task Task { get; set; }
}

public class TaskCreatedEventData : <strong>TaskEventData</strong>
{
    public User CreatorUser { get; set; }
}

public class TaskCompletedEventData : <strong>TaskEventData</strong>
{
    public User CompletorUser { get; set; }
}</pre>
			<p>Then you can implement <strong>IEventHandler&lt;TaskEventData&gt;</strong> to 
handle both of the events:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class ActivityWriter : <strong>IEventHandler&lt;TaskEventData&gt;</strong>, ITransientDependency
{
    <strong>public void HandleEvent(TaskEventData eventData)</strong>
    {
        if (eventData is TaskCreatedEventData)
        {
            //...
        }
        else if (eventData is TaskCompletedEventData)
        {
            //...
        }
    }
}</pre>
			<p>That also means you can implement IEventHandler&lt;EventData&gt; to handle all events 
			in the application. You probably don't want that, but it's possible.</p>
			<h4>Handler Exceptions</h4>
			<p>EventBus <strong>triggers all handlers</strong> even one/some of 
			them throws exception. If only one of them throws exception, then 
			it's directly thrown by the Trigger method. If more than one handler 
			throws exception, EventBus throws a single <strong>
			AggregateException</strong> for all of them.</p>
			<h4 id="DocHandleMultipleEvents">Handling Multiple Events</h4>
			<p>You can handle <strong>multiple events</strong> in a single handler. In this time, you should 
implement IEventHandler&lt;T&gt; for each event. Example:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class ActivityWriter : 
    <strong>IEventHandler&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;,</strong> 
    <strong>IEventHandler&lt;TaskCreatedEventData&gt;, </strong>
    ITransientDependency
{
    <strong>public void HandleEvent(TaskCompletedEventData eventData)</strong>
    {
        //TODO: handle the event...
    }

    <strong>public void HandleEvent(TaskCreatedEventData eventData)</strong>
    {
        //TODO: handle the event...
    }
}</pre>
			<h3 id="DocHandlerRegistration">Registration Of Handlers</h3>
			<p>We must register the handler to the event bus in order to handle events.</p>
			<h4 id="DocAutoRegister">Automatically</h4>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate finds all classes those implement <strong>IEventHandler</strong> 
			and registered to <strong>dependency injection</strong> (for 
			example, by implementing ITransientDependency as the samples above). 
			Then it 
registers them to the eventbus <strong>automatically</strong>. When an event 
occures, it uses dependency injection to get a reference to the handler and 
releases the handler after handling the event. This is the <strong>suggested</strong> 
way of using event bus in ASP.NET Boilerplate. </p>
			<h4 id="DocManualRegister">Manually</h4>
			<p>It is also possible to manually register to events but use it with caution. In a web application, event registration should be done at application start. It's not a good approach to register to an event in a web request since registered classes remain registered after request completion and re-registering for each request. This may cause problems for your application since registered class can be called multiple times. Also keep in mind that manual registration does not use dependency injection system.</p>
			<p>There are some overloads of register method of the event bus. The simplest 
one waits a delegate (or a lambda):</p>
			<pre lang="cs">EventBus.Register&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(eventData =&gt;
    {
        WriteActivity("A task is completed by id = " + eventData.TaskId);
    });
			</pre>
			<p>Thus, then a 'task completed' event occurs, this lambda method is called. 
Second one waits an object that implements IEventHandler&lt;T&gt;:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">EventBus.Register&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(new ActivityWriter());</pre>
			<p>Same instance of ActivityWriter is called for events. This method has also a 
non-generic overload. Another overload 
accepts two generic arguments:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">EventBus.Register&lt;TaskCompletedEventData, ActivityWriter&gt;();</pre>
			<p>In this time, event bus creates a new ActivityWriter for each event. It calls 
ActivityWriter.Dispose method if it's
				<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx" target="_blank">
disposable</a>.</p>
			<p>Lastly, you can register an <strong>event handler factory</strong> to handle 
creation of handlers. A handler factory has two methods: <strong>GetHandler</strong> and 
				<strong>ReleaseHandler</strong>. Example:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class ActivityWriterFactory : IEventHandlerFactory
{
    public IEventHandler GetHandler()
    {
        return new ActivityWriter();
    }

    public void ReleaseHandler(IEventHandler handler)
    {
        //TODO: release/dispose the activity writer instance (handler)
    }
}</pre>
			<p>There is also a special factory class, the <strong>IocHandlerFactory</strong>, 
that can be used to use dependency injection system to create/release handlers. 
ASP.NET Boilerplate also uses this class in automatic registration. So, if 
you want to use dependency injection system, directly use automatic 
registration defined before.</p>
			<h3 id="DocUnregister">Unregistration</h3>
			<p>When you <strong>manually</strong> register to event bus, you may want to 
				<strong>unregister</strong> to the event later. Simplest way of unregistering an event is 
disposing the return value of the <strong>Register</strong> method. Example:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">//Register to an event...
var registration = EventBus.Register&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(eventData =&gt; WriteActivity("A task is completed by id = " + eventData.TaskId) );

//Unregister from event
registration.Dispose();
			</pre>
			<p>Surely, unregistration will be somewhere and sometime else. Keep registration 
object and dispose it when you want to unregister. All overloads of the Register 
method returns a disposable object to unregister to the event.</p>
			<p>EventBus also provides <strong>Unregister</strong> method. Example usage:</p>

			<pre lang="cs">//Create a handler
var handler = new ActivityWriter();

//Register to the event
EventBus.Register&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(handler);

//Unregister from event
EventBus.Unregister&lt;TaskCompletedEventData&gt;(handler);
			</pre>
			<p>It also provides overloads to unregister delegates and factories. 
Unregistering handler object must be the same object which is registered before.</p>
			<p>Lastly, EventBus provides a <strong>UnregisterAll&lt;T&gt;()</strong> method to 
unregister all handlers of an event and <strong>UnregisterAll()</strong> method 
to unregister all handlers of all events.</p>
