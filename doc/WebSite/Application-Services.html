    Application Services are used to expose domain logic to the 
	presentation layer. An Application Service is called from presentation layer 
	with a DTO (Data Transfer Object) as parameter, uses domain objects to perform some 
	specific business logic and returns a DTO back to the presentation layer. 
	Thus, Presentation layer is completely isolated from Domain layer. In an 
	ideally layered application, presentation layer never directly works with 
	domain objects.</p>
			<h3 id="DocIApplicationServiceInterface">
    IApplicationService Interface</h3>
			<p>
    In ASP.NET Boilerplate, an application service <strong>should</strong> implement 
				<strong>IApplicationService</strong> interface. It's good to create an 
				<strong>interface</strong> for each 
	Application Service. So, we first define an interface for an application 
	service as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public interface IPersonAppService : <strong>IApplicationService</strong>
{
    void CreatePerson(<strong>CreatePersonInput</strong> input);
}</pre>
			<p>
				<strong>IPersonAppService</strong> has only one method. It's used by 
	presentation layer to create a new person.<strong> CreatePersonInput</strong> 
	is a DTO object as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cd">public class CreatePersonInput
{
    <strong>[Required]</strong>
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
}</pre>
			<p>Then we can implement the IPersonAppService:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class <strong>PersonAppService</strong> : <strong>IPersonAppService</strong>
{
    private readonly IRepository&lt;Person&gt; _personRepository;

    public PersonAppService(IRepository&lt;Person&gt; personRepository)
    {
        _personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public void CreatePerson(CreatePersonInput input)
    {
        var person = _personRepository.FirstOrDefault(p =&gt; p.EmailAddress == input.EmailAddress);
        if (person != null)
        {
            throw new UserFriendlyException(&quot;There is already a person with given email address&quot;);
        }

        person = new Person { Name = input.Name, EmailAddress = input.EmailAddress };
        _personRepository.Insert(person);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>There are some important points here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PersonAppService uses 
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories#DocRepositoryImpl">IRepository&lt;Person&gt;</a> to perform 
	database operations. It uses <strong>constructor injection</strong> pattern. 
	We're using <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">dependency 
	injection</a> here.</li>
				<li>PersonAppService implements <strong>IApplicationService</strong> (since 
	IPersonAppService extends IApplicationService), it's automatically 
	registered to Dependency Injection system by ASP.NET Boilerplate and can be 
	injected and used by other classes. Naming convention is important here. See
				<a href="Dependency-Injection.html">dependency injection</a> 
				document for more.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>CreatePerson</strong> method gets <strong>CreatePersonInput</strong>. 
	It's an <strong>input DTO</strong> and automatically validated by ASP.NET Boilerplate. See
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">DTO</a> and
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">validation</a> 
	documents for details.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="DocAppServiceClass">ApplicationService Class</h3>
			<p>An application service should implement IApplicationService interface 
			as declared above. Also,
				<strong>optionally</strong>, can be derived from <strong>ApplicationService</strong> 
base class. Thus, IApplicationService is inherently implemented. Also, 
ApplicationService class has some base functionality that makes easy to <strong>logging,</strong> 
				<strong>localization</strong> and so on... It's suggested to create a special base class for your application 
services that extends ApplicationService class. Thus, you can add some common 
functionality for all your application services. A sample application service 
class is shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskAppService : ApplicationService, ITaskAppService
{
    public TaskAppService()
    {
        LocalizationSourceName = &quot;SimpleTaskSystem&quot;;
    }

    public void CreateTask(CreateTaskInput input)
    {
        //Write some logs (Logger is defined in ApplicationService class)
        Logger.Info(&quot;Creating a new task with description: &quot; + input.Description);

        //Get a localized text (L is a shortcut for LocalizationHelper.GetString(...), defined in ApplicationService class)
        var text = L(&quot;SampleLocalizableTextKey&quot;);

        //TODO: Add new task to database...
    }
}</pre>
			<p>You can have a base class which defines <strong>LocalizationSourceName</strong> in it's 
constructor. Thus, you do not repeat it for all service classes. See
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Logging">logging</a> and
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Localization">localization</a> documents for more 
informations on this topics.</p>
			<h3>CrudAppService Class</h3>
			<p>If you want to create an application service that will have
			<strong>Create, Update, Delete, Get, GetAll</strong> methods for an 
			entity, you can inherit from <strong>CrudAppService</strong> (or
			<strong>AsyncCrudAppService</strong> if you want to create async 
			methods) class to create it easier. CrudAppService base class is
			<strong>generic </strong>which gets related <strong>Entity </strong>
			and <strong>DTO </strong>types as generic arguments and is <strong>
			extensible</strong> which allows you to override functionality when 
			you need.</p>
			<h3 id="DocUsingUow">Unit of Work</h3>
			<p>An application service method is a <strong>
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">unit of work</a>
				</strong> by default in 
ASP.NET Boilerplate. Thus, any application service method is transactional and 
			automatically saves all database changes at the end of the method.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>See <a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">unit of work</a> documentation 
for more.</p>

			<h3 id="DocAppServiceLifecycle">Lifetime of an Application Service</h3>
			<p>All application service instances are <strong>Transient</strong>. It means, they are 
instantiated per usage. See
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency Injection</a> 
documentation for more information.</p>
