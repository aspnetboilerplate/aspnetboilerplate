			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The easiest way of starting a new project using ABP and module-zero for ASP.NET Core is to create a 
	template on <a href="/Templates">templates page</a>. Remember to check "<strong>Include 
		module zero</strong>".</p>
			<p>After creating and downloading your project,</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open your solution on Visual Studio 2015+ (Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3 is recommended).</li>
				<li>Select the '<strong>Web</strong>' project as startup project.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/mrahhal/Migrator.EF6" target="_blank">Migrator.EF</a> tool is used for adding/applying EntityFramework migrations. In order to create your database, open command prompt and move to root folder of EntityFramework project in your solution. Then run "<strong>dotnet ef database update</strong>" command."</li>
				<li>Run the application. User name is '<strong>admin</strong>' and password is '<strong>123qwe</strong>' as default.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In this template, <strong>multi-tenancy is enabled by default</strong>. You 
	can disable it in Core project's module class if you don't need.</p>

			<h3>Social Logins</h3>
			<p>Startup template supports <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Google+ </strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> logins. In the web.config, you can see the 
	following settings in appsettings.json:</p>
			<pre lang="json">
 "Facebook": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "AppId": "",
  "AppSecret": ""
},
"Google": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "ClientId": "",
  "ClientSecret": ""
},
"Twitter": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "ConsumerKey": "",
  "ConsumerSecret": ""
},
"Microsoft": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "ConsumerKey": "",
  "ConsumerSecret": ""
}
			</pre>
			<p>Here, you can enable which you need. Surely, you must have application 
	keys and passwords which you need to get from related social web site. You 
	can find guides from web to learn how to obtain this keys. Once you enable a 
	social login and enter true keys, you will see a button in the login page. 
	You can implement other logins as similar.</p>
			<h3>Token Based Authentication</h3>
			<p>Startup template uses cookie based authentication for browsers. However, if you 
	want to consume Web APIs or application services (those are exposed via 
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">dynamic 
	web api</a>) from a mobile application, you probably want a token based 
	authentication mechanism. Startup template includes JwtBearer token authentication 
	infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Here, <strong>Postman</strong> (chrome extension) will be used to demonstrate 
	requests and responses.</p>
			<h4>Authentication</h4>
			<p>Just send a <strong>POST</strong> request to <strong>http://localhost:62114/jwt-token/authenticate</strong> with <strong>Context-Type="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</strong> header as shown below:</p>
			<p>
				<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Request for token" src="../images/jwt-token-authenticate.png" />
			</p>
			<p>We sent form values <strong>tenancyName</strong>, <strong>usernameOrEmailAddress
			</strong>and <strong>password</strong>. tenancyName should not be sent in order to authenticate as a 
			<strong>host </strong>user. As seen above, result property of returning JSON contains the token and expire time (which is 24 hours by default and can be configured). We can save it and use for next requests.</p>
			<h4>Use API</h4>
			<p>After authenticate and get the <strong>token</strong>, we can use it to call any <strong>authorized</strong> 
	action. All <strong>application services </strong>are available to be used remotely. For 
	example,  we can use the <strong>User service</strong> to get a <strong>list of users</strong>:</p>
			<p>
				<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Authorization via token" src="../images/jwt-token-request.png" />
			</p>
			<p>Just made a <strong>GET</strong> request to <strong>http://localhost:6234/api/services/app/user/GetUsers</strong> with <strong>
	Content-Type="application/json"</strong> and <strong>Authorization="Bearer <em>
	your-</em>
				</strong>
				<em>
					<strong>auth-token</strong>
				</em>
				<strong>"</strong>. 
	Request body was just empty <strong>{}</strong>. Surely, request and response 
	body will be different for different APIs.</p>
	<p>Note that we also added X-Requested-With header to indicate that this is an AJAX request. Thus, ASP.NET Core can better handle the request and return appropriate return values on success and error cases.</p>
			<p>Almost all operations available on UI are also available as API and can be consumed easily.</p>
			<h3>Migrator Console Application</h3>
<p>Startup template includes a tool, Migrator.exe, to easily migrate your databases. 
You can run this application to create/migrate host and tenant databases.</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Database Migrator" height="230" src="../images/database-migrator.png" width="659" /></p>
<p>This application gets host connection string from it's <strong>own .config 
file</strong>. It will be same in the web.config at the beggining. Be sure that 
the connection string in config file is the database you want. After getting
<strong class="auto-style2">host </strong><strong>connection sring</strong>, it 
first creates the host database or apply migrations if it does already exists. 
Then it gets connection strings of tenant databases and runs migrations for 
those databases. It skips a tenant if it has not a dedicated database or it's 
database is already migrated for another tenant (for shared databases between 
multiple tenants).</p>
			<p>You can use this tool on development or on product environment to 
			migrate databases on deployment, instead of EntityFramework's own 
			Migrate.exe (which requires some configuration and can work for 
			single database in one run).</p>
			<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
			<p>Startup template includes test infrastructure setup and a few tests under 
	the .Test project. You can check them and write similar tests easily. 
	Actually, they are integration tests rather than unit tests since they tests 
	your code with all ASP.NET Boilerplate infrastructure (including validation, 
	authorization, unit of work...).</p>
