				<strong>Data Transfer Objects</strong> are used to transfer data between
				<strong>Application Layer</strong> and <strong>Presentation Layer</strong>.</p>
			<p>
    Presentation Layer calls to an
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">Application Service</a> 
	method with a Data Transfer Object (<strong>DTO</strong>), then application 
	service uses domain objects to perform some specific 
	business logic and returns a DTO back to the presentation layer. Thus, Presentation layer is completely isolated from Domain layer. 
	In an ideally layered application, presentation layer does not directly work 
	with domain objects (<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repositories</a>,
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">Entities</a>...).</p>
			<h3 id="DocNeedForDTOs">The need for DTOs</h3>
			<p>To create a DTO for each Application Service method can be seen as a tedious 
and time-consuming work at first. But they can save your application if you 
correctly use it. Why?</p>
			<h4 id="DocDtoAbstractDomain">Abstraction of domain layer</h4>
			<p>DTOs provide an efficient way of abstracting domain objects from presentation 
layer. Thus, your layers are correctly seperated. Even if you want to change 
presentation layer completely, you can continue with existing application and 
domain layers. As opposite, you can re-write your domain layer, completely 
change database schema, entities and O/RM framework without any change in 
presentation layer as long as contracts (method signatures and DTOs) of your 
application services remain unchanged.</p>
			<h4 id="DocDtoDataHiding">Data hiding</h4>
			<p>Think that you have a User entity with properties Id, Name, EmailAddress and 
Password fields. If GetAllUsers() method of UserAppService returns a List&lt;User&gt;, 
anyone can see passwords of all users, even you do not show it in the screen. 
It's not just about security, it's about data hiding. Application service should 
return to presentation 
layer what it needs. Not more, not less.</p>
			<h4 id="DocDtoSerializationProblems">Serialization &amp; lazy load problems</h4>
			<p>When you return a data (an object) to presentation layer, it's probably 
serialized in somewhere. For example, in an MVC method that returns JSON, your 
object can be serialized to JSON and sent to the client. Returning an Entity to 
the presentation layer can be problematic in that case. How?</p>
			<p>In a real application, your entities will have references to each other. User 
entity can have a reference to its Roles. So, if you want to serialize User, its 
Roles are also serialized. And even Role class may have a List&lt;Permission&gt; and 
Permission class can have a reference to a PermissionGroup class and so on... Can 
you think that all of these objects are serialized? You can easily serialize 
your whole database accidently. Also, if your objects has circcular references, 
			it can not be serialized.</p>
			<p>What's the solution? Marking properties as 
NonSerialized? No, you can not know when it should be serialized and when it 
shouldn't be. It may be needed in one application service method, may not be needed in 
other. So, returning a safely serializable, specially designed DTOs are a good 
choice in this situation.</p>
			<p>Almost all O/RM frameworks support lazy-loading. It's a feature to load 
entities from database when it's needed. Say User class has a reference to Role 
class. When you get a User from database, Role property is not filled. When you 
first read the Role property, it's loaded from database. So, if you return such 
an Entity to presentation layer, it will cause to retrieve additonal 
entities from database. If a serialization tool reads the entity, it reads all 
properties recursively and again your complete database can be retrieved (if 
there are suitable relations between entities).</p>
			<p>We can say some more problems about using Entities in presentation layer. 
It's best to do not reference the assembly containing domain (business) layer to 
the presentation layer at all.</p>
			<h3 id="DocDtoConventions">DTO conventions &amp; validation</h3>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate strongly supports DTOs. It provides some conventional 
classes &amp; interfaces and advices some naming and usage conventions about DTOs. 
When you write your codes as described here, ASP.NET Boilerplate automates some 
tasks easily.&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Let's see a complete example. Say that we want to develop an application 
service method that is used to <strong>search people</strong> with a name and 
returns <strong>list of people</strong>. In that case, we may have a <strong>
Person</strong> <a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">entity</a> as shown below:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class Person : Entity
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    public virtual string <span lang="tr">P<span class="auto-style2">assword</span></span> { get; set; }
}</pre>
			<p>And we can define an interface for our 
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">application service</a>:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public interface IPersonAppService : IApplicationService
{
    SearchPeopleOutput SearchPeople(SearchPeopleInput input);
}</pre>
			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate suggest naming input/output parameters as MethodName<strong>Input</strong> 
and MethodName<strong>Output </strong>and defining a seperated input and output 
DTO for every application service method. Even if your method only take/return
				<strong>one </strong>parameter, it's better to create a DTO class. Thus, your 
code will be more extensible. You can add more properties later without changing 
signature of your method and without breaking existing client applications.</p>
			<p>Surely, your method can return <strong>void </strong>if there is no return 
value. It will not break existing applications if you add a return value later. 
If your method does not get any argument, you do not have to define an input 
DTO. But it maybe better to write an input DTO class if it's probable to add 
parameter in the future. This is up to you.</p>
			<p>Let's see input and output DTO classes defined for this example:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class SearchPeopleInput
{
    [StringLength(40, MinimumLength = 1)]
    public string SearchedName { get; set; }
}

public class SearchPeopleOutput
{
    public List&lt;PersonDto&gt; People { get; set; }
}

public class PersonDto : EntityDto
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
}</pre>
			<p>
				ASP.NET Boilerplate <strong>automatically validates</strong> input before execution 
of the method. It's similar to ASP.NET MVC's validation, but notice that 
application service is not a Controller, it's a plain C# class. ASP.NET 
Boilerplate makes interception and check input automatically. There are much 
more about validation. See
				<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">DTO validation</a> 
document.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>EntityDto</strong> is a simple class that declares
				<strong>Id property</strong> since they are common for entities. 
				Has a generic version if your entity's primary key is not int. 
				You don't have to use it, but can be better to define an Id 
				property.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>PersonDto</strong> does 
not include Password property as you see, since it's not needed for presentation 
layer. Even it can be dangerous to send all people's password to presentation 
layer. Think that a Javascript client requested it, anyone can easily grab all 
passwords.</p>
			<p>Let's implement <strong>IPersonAppService</strong> before go further.</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class PersonAppService : IPersonAppService
{
    private readonly IPersonRepository _personRepository;

    public PersonAppService(IPersonRepository personRepository)
    {
        _personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public SearchPeopleOutput SearchPeople(SearchPeopleInput input)
    {
        //Get entities
        var peopleEntityList = _personRepository.GetAllList(person =&gt; person.Name.Contains(input.SearchedName));

        //Convert to DTOs
        var peopleDtoList = peopleEntityList
            .Select(person =&gt; new PersonDto
                                {
                                    Id = person.Id,
                                    Name = person.Name,
                                    EmailAddress = person.EmailAddress
                                }).ToList();

        return new SearchPeopleOutput { People = peopleDtoList };
    }
}</pre>
			<p>We get entities from database, <strong>convert </strong>them to DTOs and 
return output. Notice that we did not validated input. ASP.NET Boilerplate
				<strong>validate</strong>s it. It even checks <strong>if input parameter is null
				</strong>and throws exception if so. This saves us to write guard clauses in 
every method.</p>
			<p>But, probably you did not like converting code from a Person entity to a 
PersonDto object. It's really a tedious work. Person entity could have much more 
properties. </p>
			<h3 id="DocAutoMapping">Auto mapping between DTOs and entities</h3>
			<p>Fortunately there are tools that makes this very easy. <strong>
					<a href="http://automapper.org/" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>
				</strong> is one 
of them. It's distributed on nuget, you can easily add to your project. Let's 
write SearchPeople method again but using AutoMapper:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public SearchPeopleOutput SearchPeople(SearchPeopleInput input)
{
    var peopleEntityList = _personRepository.GetAllList(person =&gt; person.Name.Contains(input.SearchedName));
    return new SearchPeopleOutput { People = Mapper.Map&lt;List&lt;PersonDto&gt;&gt;(peopleEntityList) };
}</pre>
			<p>That's all. You can add more properties to entity and DTO but converting code 
does not change. The only thing to do is define a mapping before using it:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">Mapper.CreateMap<span lang="tr">&lt;</span>Person, PersonDto<span lang="tr">&gt;</span>();</pre>
			<p>AutoMapper creates mapping code. Thus, dynamic mapping does not become 
a performance problem. It's fast &amp; easy. AutoMapper creates a PersonDto for a Person entity and assign DTO's properties 
using naming conventions. Naming conventions can be complex and configurable. Also, 
you can define custom maps and much more. See <a href="http://automapper.org/" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>'s documentation 
for more information.</p>
			<p>You can define mappings in <a href="Module-System.html">
			PostInitialize</a> of your module for example.</p>

			<h4 id="DocAutoMappingHelpers">Mapping using attributes and extension methods</h4>

			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides several attributes and extension methods to define mappings. 
To use it, add
				<a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Abp.AutoMapper">Abp.AutoMapper</a> nuget 
package to your project. Then, use attribute
				<strong>AutoMap</strong> for two way mapping, <strong>AutoMapFrom</strong> and <strong>AutoMapTo</strong> for one way mapping.
Use <strong>MapTo </strong> extension methods to map one object to another. 
Example mapping definition:</p>

			<pre lang="cs">[AutoMap(typeof(MyClass2))] //define two-way mapping
public class MyClass1
{
    public string TestProp { get; set; }
}

public class MyClass2
{
    public string TestProp { get; set; }
}</pre>

			<p>Then you can map them using MapTo extension method:</p>

			<pre lang="cs">var obj1 = new MyClass1 { TestProp = "Test value" };
var obj2 = obj1.MapTo&lt;MyClass2&gt;(); //Creates a new MyClass2 object with TestProp copied from obj1.</pre>

			<p>The code above creates a new MyClass2 object from a MyClass1 object. Also, 
you can map to an existing object as shown below:</p>
			<pre>var obj1 = new MyClass1 { TestProp = &quot;Test value&quot; };
var obj2 = new MyClass2();
obj1.MapTo(obj2); //Sets properties of obj2 from obj1</pre>

			<h3 id="DocHelperDtoInterfaces">Helper interfaces and classes</h3>

			<p>ASP.NET provides some helper interfaces that can be implemented to
standardize common DTO property names.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>ILimitedResultRequest </strong>defines <strong>MaxResultCount</strong>
property. So, you can implement it in your input DTOs to standardize limiting
result set.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>IPagedResultRequest</strong> extends <strong>ILimitedResultRequest</strong>
by adding <strong>SkipCount</strong>. So, we can implement this interface in
SearchPeopleInput for paging:</p>

			<pre lang="cs">public class SearchPeopleInput : IPagedResultRequest
{
    [StringLength(40, MinimumLength = 1)]
    public string SearchedName { get; set; }

    public int MaxResultCount { get; set; }
    public int SkipCount { get; set; }
}
			</pre>
			<p>As a result to a paged request, you can return an output DTO that implements
				<strong>IHasTotalCount</strong>. Naming standardization helps us to create 
re-usable codes and conventions. See other interfaces and classes under <strong>
Abp.Application.Services.Dto</strong> namespace.</p>
